# Predictions in Hospital Mortality Due to Heart Failure 
> This is an overview of a data mining project I completed in Spring of '21. It is a collection of statistical models, most notibly logistical regression, used to predict the mortaility rate of paitents who enter the ICU due to heart failure.

## General Information
- The business goal of our model is to predict the mortality rate of patients who enter the
ICU (Intensive Care Units) due to heart failure. This model will be used to provide doctors with
information about what patients they need to prioritize in order to reduce patient-in-house
mortality rates. This model will be presented to hospital owners and doctors.
- Based on the results from our logistical regression, we recommend that doctors implement risk-adjusted mortality.
Risk-adjusted mortality can be defined as the ability to prioritize patients based on characteristics
that predict the risk of death. This can be implemented by increasing attention to patients with
the following factors: occurrence of Atrial Fibrillation, high anion gap levels, high heart rate,
increased respiratory rate, high BMI, aged 70-90, high blood pressure (hypertensive), and
diabetic patients. By implementing this practice, healthcare providers can decrease in-hospital
mortality rates by monitoring the most influential factors in fatal heart failure cases.

- Rattle File 


## Setup
To complete this project we found a dataset on Kaggle, cleaned this data through Excel and Rattle, and performed any data pre-processing through Rattle to transform the data to resolve any issues and make the dataset more complete and efficient to perform the data analysis.


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ as of December of 2021

## What I Learned
Throughout this experience I learned how to utilize R and Rattle. I also learned the importance of cleaning data and data visualization.
